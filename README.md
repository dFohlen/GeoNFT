# NFT-Geocaching

## ℹ️ General Info
This project is/was designed and implemented by the Capgemini Invent developers [Volker Dufner](https://github.com/dFohlen), [Tim Schmitz](https://github.com/0x0tim) and [Jonas Engelhardt](https://github.com/joengelh) as part of the [Solana Summer Hackathon](https://solana.com/summercamp).

## 📝 Concept
The concept behind NFT geocaching is that with our mobile app, the community can drop off their NFTs at a specific location of their choice and the finder can pick them up. This creates an incentive to get outside and look for potentially valuable NFTs.

Since the hackathon is hosted by [Solana](https://solana.com/), we also use the corresponding Solana blockchain and the newly developed [Solana Mobile Stack](https://solana.com/de/news/solana-mobile-stack-reveal).


## 🗺️ Demo Flow

1. The NFT holder goes to a location of his choice where he would like to place the NFT.
2. The NFT and the location coordinates are then sent from the holders wallet to our smart contract. The coordinates are additionally encrypted to prevent misuse or theft of the NFTs.
3. Searchers can now use the app to see where the nearest NFTs are and make their way there.
4. The first person who finds the NFT gets the opportunity to take it. This is transferred from the smart contract to the finders wallet.
